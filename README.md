# WTFggerat

## End-user support/pull requests will be ignored.

## What?

Personal/private emulator/UI code playset for anything above Intel Ivy Bridge-level CPUs.

Aiming to support:
* SNES
* N64
* PSX

and nothing else. Have zero interest in anything else.

## Why?

* Boredom/something to work on. Why not?
* Seen everyone do things their way, why can't I mess with mine?
* Got tired of libretro/RA's reluctance to API changes.
* Got tired of libretro/RA's other many BS things.
* A means to **play games** how I want to. Everyone else can do "preservation".

## How?

* Meson
* MSYS2 (on Windows)
* Modern G++/GCC 
* Visual Studio Code
* SDL2
* dear-imgui
* Modern C++ like C++17

Don't even ask how to compile.
