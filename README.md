# WTFggerat

## What?

Personal/private emulator/UI code playset for anything above Intel Ivy Bridge-level CPUs.

Aiming to support:
* SNES
* N64
* PSX

and nothing else. Have zero interest in anything else.

## Why?

* Boredom/something to work on.
* Seen everyone do things their way, why can't I?
* Got tired of libretro/RA's BS/reluctance for API changes.
* A means to **play games how I want to.** Everyone else can do "hardware preservation".

## How?

* OGL 3.3 (only)
* C++17 using G++
* SDL2
* dear-imgui
* Meson
* MSYS2 on Windows
* Visual Studio Code
